substitutions:
  B: 5
  var7: 79
package_result:
  - The value of A*B is 35, where A is a package var and B is a substitution in the
    root file
  - Double substitution also works; the value of var7 is 79, where A is a package
    var
  - key79: Key should substitute to key79
local_results:
  - The value of B is 5
  - 'You will see, however, that

    ${A} is not substituted here, since

    it is out of scope.

    '
